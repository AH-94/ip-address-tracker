# ip-address-tracker
An IP address tracker API that enables location searches based on IP information

The code uses the ipify IP Geolocation API, available at: https://www.ipify.org/

In combination with leaflet.js, the javascript uses the JSON data returned from ipify's API to generate a map and plot the location to the user.
